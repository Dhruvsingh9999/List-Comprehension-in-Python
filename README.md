# List Comprehension Examples

This repository, maintained by **Dhruvsingh9999**, contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various applications of **list comprehensions** in Python. The notebook is beginner-friendly and showcases how to transform, filter, and manipulate data using list comprehensions, along with similar techniques for dictionaries and sets.

## Features

- **Basic List Comprehensions**  
  Learn the syntax and use cases of list comprehensions, including:
  - Squaring numbers in a list
  - Filtering numbers based on conditions
  
- **Nested Conditions**  
  See examples of combining `if` and `else` conditions for advanced filtering and transformations.

- **Nested Loops**  
  Explore how to handle nested loops effectively with list comprehensions.

- **Dictionary Comprehensions**  
  Create and filter dictionaries using concise one-liners.

- **Set Comprehensions**  
  Use set comprehensions to eliminate duplicates and transform data.

- **Real-Life Examples**  
  Practical applications like categorizing numbers, grading systems, and character mapping in strings.
